# Multi-cursor

In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can type or edit several lines of code simultaneously using a feature called "multi-cursor." This allows you to place cursors at multiple positions in your document and make changes at all those positions at once. It's particularly useful for editing multiple lines of code similarly or adding the same piece of code in multiple places. Here's how to use it:


## Method 1: Using Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Add a Cursor: 
Press Alt (Windows/Linux) or Option (Mac) and click at each point where you want to add a cursor.

#### Add Cursors to Line Ends: 
Press Ctrl+Alt+Down (Windows/Linux) or Ctrl+Cmd+Down (Mac) to add cursors below the current line. Use Up instead of Down to add cursors above.



## Method 2: Selecting Similar Text

#### Select Next Occurrence: 
Place your cursor on a piece of text, then press Ctrl+D (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+D (Mac) to add the next instance of the selected text to your selection. Repeat this shortcut to add more occurrences.

#### Select All Occurrences: 
To select all instances of the current selection at once, press Ctrl+Shift+L (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+L (Mac).



## Method 3: Column (Box) Selection

You can also make a column selection, which doesn't need to start at the beginning of the line. Press Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac), then drag your mouse vertically. This is useful for editing columns of text.



## Tips for Using Multi-Cursor Effectively

#### Editing: 
Once you have multiple cursors, you can start typing, and the input will appear at all cursor locations.

#### Navigation: 
You can use arrow keys to navigate your cursors simultaneously.

#### Deletion: 
Backspace and Delete work with multi-cursors as well, allowing you to delete text from multiple places at once.



Multi-cursor editing can significantly speed up repetitive editing tasks and make it easier to maintain consistency across your code.
